# PWA Assignemnt
Created a PWA todo app using vanilla Javascript.

## App details
Created a page containing the following elements: 
1. A header with name 'To Do Tracker - Application' 
2. A subheader with name 'Imtiyaz Shaikh (A00456832)'
3. A form with 3 inputs 
    a. Task Name
    b. Due Date using datetime picker to get **bonus point**
    c. Assigned To
    
4. Markdown is completed as per the ask.
5. IndexedDB is implemented with auto-incremented 'id' column to secure **bonus point**.
6. Service worker, Manifest, icons are added.
7. Screenshots are available under "screenshots" folder which were part of unit testing and to make evaluation easy. :)

## Cross validating rubric from my end:
At the end, you'll have an app similar to the todo app in `02-local-storage` but with extra inputs and data.
I will grade based on the following: 
- Todo app is working (2.5 pts) : **Done**
- Data gets saved correcly to IndexedDB (2.5 pts) : **Done**
- The app is PWA (3pts) â€“ App works offline, app has icon, & app is installable (you can check that, by making sure you see the app manifest file inside Chrome Dev Tool) : **Done**
- Bonus point: see above (1 pt) : **Done**
